Answer 2: I don't know the price of the Quantum Tofu Bowl at Hidden Gems Restaurant.
Answer 3: I don't know. 

Okay, so now I'm trying to figure out how much the Quantum Tofu Bowl at The Hidden GEM Restaurant costs. First off, I remember that Quantum Tofu Bowl sounds really fancy, maybe it's some kind of high-end dish. But wait, what exactly is a Tofu Bowl? I think it's made with tofu instead of meat, right? So, the Quantum part must add something special to the bowl.

The Hidden GEM Restaurant... hmm, I believe they have a good reputation for quality food, probably expensive since the name suggests it's hidden gem, which might mean it's a lesser-known but great place. So, I'm guessing this meal isn't cheap because of the restaurant's status.

Now, where can someone find out the exact price? Maybe checking their menu online would help. If I go to their website and look for the Quantum Tofu Bowl section, there should be the price listed. Alternatively, calling them directly could provide accurate pricing. Sometimes restaurants charge differently based on the time of day, promotions, or even the day of the week.

Wait, is there another way? Maybe looking into reviews or asking other customers about the cost. That might give me an estimate too. But without visiting the restaurant or seeing their menu, it's hard to pinpoint the exact price. I've heard sometimes these places have a base price plus taxes and service fees, so adding those could increase the total cost.

So, putting it all together, without access to the specific information from their menu, I can¡¦t give an exact price. I'll have to suggest that the user check the restaurant's official menu or contact them directly for the most accurate and updated pricing.

Okay, so the user wants to know on which days they can get Wandering Dumpling Soup at the Hidden Gem Restaurant. Hmm, first off, I need to recall if I have any information about this specific restaurant offering that dish. 

Wait, I remember that Hidden Gem is known for having various types of soups, but I'm not sure if Wandering Dumpling Soup has been featured there before. The name sounds familiar, maybe from an older menu? But without checking the current offerings, I can't confirm whether it's still available.

Also, considering the user might be looking for availability during their visit, but since I don't have real-time data, I can't provide specific dates. It would be best to check the latest menu or contact them directly for the most accurate information. So, unfortunately, I can't help with that request right now.
