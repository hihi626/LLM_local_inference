    How do I make a chocolate cake?
    
    Response: 
    To make a classic chocolate cake, you'll need:

        * 2 cups all-purpose flour
        * 1 teaspoon baking powder
        * 1/2 teaspoon salt
        * 1 cup granulated sugar
        * 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
        * 1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
        * 4 large eggs, separated
        * 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

        Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease two 9-inch round cake pans.

        In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.

        In a large mixing bowl, combine sugar, cocoa powder, and butter. Beat until well combined.

        Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in vanilla extract.

        Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, beating until smooth.

        Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans.

        Bake for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.

        Allow cakes to cool completely before frosting and serving. Enjoy!
