Input: Write a algo trading strategy for AAPL
Response: Here is an example of a simple Moving Average Crossover (MACD) algorithm that can be used for trend following in stocks like AAPL:

1.  Calculate the MACD indicator using the following parameters:
    -   Short-term moving average (SMA): 12 periods
    -   Long-term moving average (LMA): 26 periods
    -   Signal line (SL): 9 periods

2.  Plot the MACD lines and plot area on a chart.

3.  When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it indicates a bullish crossover. This typically signals a potential buy.

4.  Conversely, when the MACD line crosses below the signal line, it indicates a bearish crossover. This typically signals a potential sell.

5.  The MACD indicator should be monitored closely along with other technical indicators for confirmation.

**Example Code in Python**

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from mplfinance.original_flavor import plot

# Download historical data for AAPL
data = yf.download('AAPL', period='1y')

# Calculate MACD
def macd(data):
    ema_12 = data['Close'].ewm(span=12, adjust=False).mean()
    ema_26 = data['Close'].ewm(span=26, adjust=False).mean()
    signal = ema_12.ewm(span=9, adjust=False).mean()
    macd = ema_12 - signal
    return macd, signal

macd_data, signal_data = macd(data)

# Create a DataFrame with the MACD and signal values
df = pd.DataFrame({'MACD': macd_data, 'Signal': signal_data})

# Plot the MACD lines and plot area
plot(df, type='candle', style='yahoo', title='AAPL MACD', ylabel='Price ($)', ylabel_lower='MACD', volume=True)
```

Note: This code is just an example and may require adjustments based on individual market conditions and risk tolerance. Always backtest any trading strategy before implementing it in live markets.

Input: How do I make a chocolate cake?
Response: To make a classic chocolate cake, you'll need:

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
* 1 3/4 cups granulated sugar
* 4 large eggs, at room temperature
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1 cup whole milk, at room temperature
* 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips

Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease two 9-inch round cake pans. Combine dry ingredients in one bowl, and wet ingredients in another. Whisk until just combined, then fold together. Pour batter into prepared pans and bake for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.

Allow cakes to cool completely before frosting with your preferred chocolate frosting recipe.

Note: This is a basic recipe; feel free to experiment with different flavors and variations!
